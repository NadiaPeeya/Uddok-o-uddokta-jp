Study shows that a huge number of skilled and semi skilled women are struggling for livelihood in rural level (especially in our target areas) who are very much passionate to do something. They just need skills up-gradation, business management training and a sustainable platform to do so.
The support we are planning to do is the best way for them to move forward and improve their living standard. Zhumka Bangladesh has already provided skills training to them on Tailoring, Jute Products, Bamboo Products, Cane Products, Wooden Products, Cultural handicrafts etc. to 5000 (approx.) women and they are eagerly waiting to start their own business in small scale!
